# project1_sql_transactions
This is my first project on Github and I'll be using SQL to exlore and clean retail sales for a shop.
I first turned the Excel file from CSV to SQL using a website converter. Then, I counted the data to make sure nothing is missing and compared it by Excel tables count which is 2000.
Checking if any of the columns are null and found three rows with ID: 679, 746 and 1225 are null, so I'm going to delete them.
